# Medical-Appointment-No-Shows
Many times individuals do not show up for a medical appointment. Previous studies have shown that about 25% of the individuals did not appear.  No-show is a misfortune for doctors since they lose their payments. However, patients who needed an appointment at the earliest opportunity were unfit to get one.  Henceforth, there are two misfortunes: the money related misfortune for the specialist and the loss of appointment for the individual in need.
The aim of the project is to help to answer the question, "how likely is a patient with certain attributes, to show up to his hospital appointment?" We will explore the data and look for relationships between variables, to pave the way for more extensive modeling.
