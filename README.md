# Medical-Appointment-No-Shows

Many times individuals do not show up for a medical appointment. Previous studies have shown that about 25% of the individuals did not appear.  No-show is a misfortune for doctors since they lose their payments. However, patients who needed an appointment at the earliest opportunity were unfit to get one.  Henceforth, there are two misfortunes: the money related misfortune for the specialist and the loss of appointment for the individual in need.

The aim of the project is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.

It is basically divided into four sections: 

1. __Introduction__, where the investigation problem is set and the dataset is described
2. __Data Wrangling__, where the acquired data are cleaned and parsed
3. __Exploratory Data Analysis__, in which some intuition about the data are built based on the found patterns
4. __Conclusion__, where the found insights about the problem are reviewed
